# ðŸ“‚ Description

There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't (haha ;P). If you are among the people who do not understand this computer joke, then the LXRobotics Binary Watch Shield is just the thing for you. In conjunction with an Arduino, the Binary Watch Shield may in fact be used to display the current time in binary format. Thereby, learning binary code will become a child's play. For the quick start, a finished Arduino Library with a binary clock sample program is available.

**Features**

* Display of the current time (HH:MM) in binary format using red, orange and green LEDs
* I2C-Real Time Clock  (RTC) for the watch functionality
* Arduino Library available for control with binary clock example programms
